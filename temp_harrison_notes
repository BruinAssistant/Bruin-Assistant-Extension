Important Notes:
- multiple background scripts can be added
- should only set up one listener type across all background scripts
	- use this one to receive message (for example), and then delegate the task accordingly
- Message Passing: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging/
- PROPERLY USE AN ARROW FUNCTION >:(
